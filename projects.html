          I did this project on SOLIDWORKS with a team of 4 people. We designed a prototype of a weed pulling gardening tool that had retractable claws to dig into the ground and pull out weeds!

        <p>
          I work in a research lab where we design materials and code for robotics. Recently, I've been working on developing a 3D printer integrating a single screw extruder with a continuous fiber-reinforced composite annular nozzle.

      <h2>3D Printed Autonomous Rover</h2>
      <!-- Project description text -->
      <p>
        I was inspired by NASA's Curiosity Rover and made an autonomous robot that had 3D Printed Parts. I submitted this project in my high school science fair and we won 1st place at Regionals! I used a lot of ideas from NASA's blueprint of Curiosity itself, but also other hobbyists on the internet. I learned a lot about 3D Printing from this project.

      <h2>Additive Manufacturing Housing Research</h2>
      <!-- Project description text -->
      <p>
        I conducted research on how 3D Printed houses would be more beneficial to designated disaster areas compared to traditional housing responses. I conducted a quantitative content analysis and concluded that 3D Printing houses in light of natural disasters would be more beneficial to the citizens of that area in various different perspectives.
